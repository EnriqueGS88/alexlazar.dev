I’m constantly having debates with myself about saving and investing. Here’s what came out of the latest.

# Dictionary 📓

For the purpose of this discussion, let’s establish some terms.

- BMLE = bare minimum living expenses
- saving = cash or cash equivalents (stablecoins, etc)
- investments = (mostly) illiquid assets that produce an ROI in the form of cashflow or appreciation
- cashflow = regular income generated (mostly) passively
- appreciation = value increases over time
- nominal = doesn’t include inflation

# What is saving? 🪙

**_You take away from resources you have today and putting them aside for later usage._**

This usage could be:

- emergencies (i.e.: runway in case you lose your job)
- lifestyle purchases (i.e: saving up for a car or vacation)
- investment opportunities (i.e.: waiting for a business / investment idea)

You have to be aware that saving in and of itself means incurring costs in the forms of:

- loss of lifestyle quality (you spend less to save)
- inflation (your savings lose value with time)
- opportunity cost (could have made an ROI if invested immediately)

Think of these costs as an insurance premium.

We’re talking now strictly about saving in and of itself, so let’s set aside lifestyle purchases (very subjective) or investment opportunities (I’ll tackle it later).

## Example A

You predict that there may be lay offs soon. You believe you can find a new job within 6 months.

It may make sense to have 6 months of runway to protect yourself against that emergency.

It may not make sense to have 12 months of runway because you’re incurring too much “insurance premium” for no added benefit.

## Example B

You don’t predict any upcoming lay offs. You know you could get a new job within 3 months. You have a side-hustle that can cover `BMLE`. You own a rental property that pays half of `BMLE` and you know you could borrow against it.

Do you really need any savings? There’s no real benefit to paying that “insurance premium”.

# What is investing? 📈

**_You take away from resources you have today and lock them inside an investment vehicle for potential future gain._**

Simplified: you suffer now so you may have more tomorrow.

You’re still incurring the costs of saving + more:

- loss of lifestyle quality (you spend less to invest)
- inflation (the value of money shrinks)
- opportunity cost (could have made a bigger ROI if invested in ✨something else✨)
- risk cost (there’s a chance you lose value, maybe even all value of the investment)
- time cost (the longer the investment is locked, the lower your ROI / year)
- taxes (fairly obvious, but many fail to account for them)

Let’s dive deeper into each of these. Except the first one, that’s fairly obvious and basic.

## Explaining inflation in the context of ROI

I believe the simplest way to explain this is to give a hypothetical analogy.

Year 1: you have $100 in cash, price of bread is $1, price of SP500 is $100.

You buy $100 worth of SP500.

Year 2: price of bread is $2, price of SP500 is $150.

On paper you had a 50% ROI (or a 1,5x multiple). In reality, you can’t even buy a full bread anymore.

This was a hypothetical hyperbole, but you get the point.

There can be cases where cost of living increases beyond your ROI. And, even if it doesn’t, it steal eats into your real ROI.

## Explaining opportunity cost

Yet another hypothetical analogy for you.

Year 1: you have $100 in cash, price of SP500 $100, price of gold $100.

You buy gold for $100 because you think it’s safer (we’ll talk about that in risk cost).

Year 2: price of SP500 is $150, price of gold is $110.

You technically made an ROI of 10% (or a 1,1x multiple) which you may argue is good.

But you could have made an ROI of 50% (or a 1,5x multiple).

In this hypothetical example, you lost the opportunity of making that extra $40.

## Calculating opportunity cost

This is very hard to calculate because there can always be another (potentially better) investment and hindsight is 20/20.

A good idea IMO is to compare to the actual returns of a historically stable investment vehicle, like the SP500.

The index has returned a historic annualised average return of around (nominal) **10,5%** since its 1957 inception through 2021.

In a real life setting, if you had an ROI of less than ~10,5%, I’d say you have incurred statistical opportunity cost.

Now, of course, if the SP500 (and any other average investment vehicle) generated less than 5% and you generated 5% ROI, then you may have incurred statistical opportunity cost, but not real opportunity cost.

So, again, even using the SP500 (or any other stable-ish metric), you still can’t come up with a reasonable number that works on any given time period.

This is highly contextual, but still a cost to be aware of.

## Explaining risk cost

I guess you know what’s coming by now? An oversimplified made-up example of what ✨could✨ happen?

Not exactly… this time we’re taking a look at a roulette game.

If you’ve never played it, let me explain the European version.

You have a big wheel with 37 slots on it. Each slot has a number ranging from 0 to 36. 18 slots are red, 18 are black and the slot that has 0 is green.

You can bet on a red/black, on a specific slot, on multiple slots at a time, or on different pre-set combos like betting on the smallest 12 numbers.

Let’s focus on betting on colours to keep it super simple.

If you bet on red, for example, and you win… you double your money.

$1 in. $2 out. 100% ROI (or 2x multiple).

Sounds good enough, before you factor in the risk.

The chances of you landing red (or black for that matter) are ~48,64%.

Why not 50%? Because of that one green slot.

So, if you were to run the numbers `bet * multiple * chances = average result` that’d mean `$1 * 2 * 48,64% ~= $0,97`.

Meaning that, when you account for probability or “the risk cost”, **for every $1 you put in you receive $0,97.**

**✨An averaged net 3% loss on every bet you make.✨**

## Factoring risk

As long as you don't go to underground games where the house may be cheating, predicting the roulette is fairly clear.

Bet on red: 48,64% chance of winning, if you win you double and if you lose you lose it all. Nets you a 3% loss per bet on average. Conclusion? Don’t bet!

Easy enough, right?

It’s much harder when you factor in the risk of investing in real estate, stocks, crypto, etc.

There’s no clear ‘winning’ or ‘losing’.

You may win 5% or 100%. You never know where the peak is. You may lose 5% or 100%. You don’t know where the bottom is either.

**_Sidenote: Yes, investment vehicles can and do sometimes go to $0._**

You might look at historical data and say “but the SP500 only dropped by ~20% at worst in the past 50 years” or “the index has returned a historic annualised average return of around (nominal) **10,5%** since its 1957 inception through 2021.”

Not false, **but past performance is not always a perfect indicator of future performance** (a discussion for another time perhaps).

**_Sidenote: I’m perfectly aware I mentioned the annualised average return of the SP500 myself. The irony right? 😅_**

## Factoring time

Back to the roulette, each bet takes less than a minute to show the result. More importantly, it has a clear ending point.

Your real estate, stock or crypto ‘bet’ may take moments or years to fructify. Not only that, but it has no clear ending point. It’s an ongoing ‘bet’.

As your bet or investments takes longer to close, your ROI lowers. Care for another highly hypothetical example?

Year 1: you purchase SP500 at $100 / “unit” expecting it to go to $200

Year 2: SP500 is at $105 / unit

Year 3: SP500 is at $110 / unit

Year 4: SP500 is at $200 / unit, you close at $200

You just doubled your money. That’s a 100% ROI.

But, it’s a 100% ROI over 4 years. Annualised that’s ~25%.

**_Sidenote: I’m also aware that saying it’s 25% is a simplification of the math._**

Yet another example of the time factor, and this time a real-life example, is [Michael Burry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/).

He predicted the 2008 crisis. But he called it quite early, therefore losing money in the process until his prediction happened and investment closed.

It’s true that in his case it was more complicated than just doing `ROI / years` as he had to pay premiums on his investment vehicles. Another discussion for another time.

Also, he did end up making a lot of money. Still, an example of the time factor and how it can change what your real net ROI looks like.

## Taxes

Everyone likes to look at the “you’ll make X% per year” claims, but a lot forget that they usually have to pay taxes on that gain.

This is highly dependant on the jurisdiction you are in, so I won’t dwell on it.

The point is, out of the ROI you (hopefully) manage to take, the government takes it’s share.

Oh, and btw, they do not account for inflation, risk cost or anything like that.

**They take straight out of your nominal ROI.** 😊

# What should I invest in?

I could invest in US based vehicles like the SP500 and whatnot. They’re historically stable and beat inflation, right? But what if you don’t believe in the USA maintaining its status as leader of the world?

I could invest in crypto. That’s anti-establishment and if you believe in the tech (which I do) sounds good enough. Okay, but which crypto? I’d have believed in the internet back in 2000 but how should I have known for sure which companies would have survived?

I could invest in real estate. But I have an issue with the inflexibilities that provides. I don’t want to be tied to any one government.

I could invest in local private businesses. But then I’d have to manage it.

Gold? Historically not great ROIs.

Should I just save cash and wait for amazingly obvious opportunities like a crash? But then I’d incur the costs mentioned in the first part of this article.

# You see? It’s complicated 😅

While the basic premise of investing…

> You take from resources you have today and lock them inside an investment vehicle for potential future gain.

… is simple and sounds good in theory (you suffer today to be rich tomorrow).

In truth, **it’s much more complicated than that and your results may vary**.

**_Disclaimer: I’m not a financial expert and you should obviously do whatever the fuck you want to do._**
