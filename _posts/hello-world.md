I've put in a good 3 days into building this .md file based blog, and I actually really like it.

I'm to spent to write anything right now though.

But... **hello world**, welcome to my blog.

Cheers!

P.S.: I actually still need to integrate ConvertKit in that newsletter form you see, but whatever.
