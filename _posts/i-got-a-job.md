## I made almost $20k last year freelancing and I quit

If you've read [this article](/why-i-quit-freelancing) you already know that back then I had decided that I want to try my luck getting a job/contract as a dev in a crypto company, even though freelancing wasn't that bad and I was on the up and up.

I did that because:

- Web3 development is generally better paid than web dev;
- It's a grind to find and negociate with new clients all the time;
- I wanted a challenge.

## I announced all of my clients and started looking

This may be something a lot of you don't have the stomach to do, but I simply announced all of my clients I won't be freelancing anymore before having even 1 lead as to getting a job.

I got a tip that [inverse.finance](https://inverse.finance) is hiring and so I started being active on their discord, helping how I could. I also started buggering them about a job.

They were friendly when talking to me (even though I was clear I knew nothing about web3 yet). They told me to learn and build a portfolio using Solidity, ethers.js, hardhat and they'd consider me.

This lead me to build [this](https://github.com/lazaralex98/voting-contract). It's a contract + dApp where you can make proposals for me to make YT videos and vote on existent proposals.

_Side note: I have a [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTlMP2ODwm0_Apy4wMoy5g)_

After presenting it to them they told me they are looking for a senior (I obviously don't fit that description yet üòÇ).

It kinda pissed me off as they could've let me know from the get go, but I did have on small web3 project in my portfolio now, so I moved on.

## An unlikely event presented me another opportunity

I somehow met Frank Turtle ([and I did an interview with him too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KxMbgragJY)), and he was also looking to break into web3.

He pointed me to [Toucan.earth](https://toucan.earth). They were looking to hire plenty of devs.

So I went straight to their discord and offered to help by building [a Discord Bot that praises people](https://github.com/lazaralex98/toucan-discord-praise-bot).

Literally without any promise (or knowledge about discord bots), I started building this project.

In about 20 days of full-time work on this (quitting all of my client work did have its benefits, you see) I had a ERC20 customised token, a discord bot and a website for authentication.

After showing it to [James](https://twitter.com/positonic) (he's the CTO), he asked me if I want to be paid for the bot.

![How I asked James for a job](/how-i-asked-james-for-a-job.png)

I obviously said no, but I did request a job.

## My trial month

After a short discussion on Zoom (or whatever we used), me and James decided to do a trial month to see if we're a fit.

_Funny fact: He had asked me "when can you start?" twice (before the call and during the call) and I answered "today" or "right now" on both occasions. I think they loved my enthusiasm._

I learned **A LOT** during that trial month. Also, I fell in love with the team & culture, and I guess they liked me too since I got employed full-time. üíö

## Remember the drawbacks talk when I decided to quit freelancing?

I was a bit afraid that maybe I'll be less free/flexible if I got a job vs freelance.

The reality (for me at Toucan), is that I'm just as free, if not more free. I make my own schedule. I can take a day off whenever I feel like it. They don't care where I work from.

And, because this is a full-time position, I actually have better work-life balance.

My teammates are also super cool. I get paid far more per year than I did freelancing. I couldn't be more happy at Toucan.

One of the best decisions I've made.

P.S.: I also want to thank a friend of mine who is the one that initially adviced me to give web3 a shot. He's name is Sam, but I think he may want to stay anonymous. If you're reading this, thanks again Sam üôèüèª
